<h2>Ancient History</h2>

<p>In a past life I was a registered investment advisor and worked as an analyst mostly on portfolio construction and 
on building combinations of actively managed equity portfolios
<br>
Here's my very short and very clean <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/individual/summary/6461678" >U-4 </a>

<br>

While a career as an investment advisor or financial analyst of any kind was clearly not for me,
I'm always happy to talk to people about how to go about finding an advisor to work with, how they can lead a healthy
 financial life, or just answer random questions about financial markets or economics. 

If you want someone to take a less partial look at an investment portfolio or product that you've been offered I'd be happy to do so.
