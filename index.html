            Hi, I'm hugh
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm interested in programming, data analysis especially of a spatial nature, making software and cities work better for their least powerful users and repairing mechanical things. 
          </p> 
          <p> 
            Don't hesitate to reach out to say hi, tell me how you found this site, ask a question or tell me why I'm wrong about something. 
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the main goals of this site is my effort to control my personal data myself and to make data about my life available to other people. 

            Over time I hope to have the majority of my exercise data, travel data, spending data and anything else I can think of up here for your enjoyment.  
          </p>
          <p>

            One of the things that prompted me to do this was thinking about who I'm most comfortable having information about my life.

            If you're reading this, I'm probably much more comfortable with you knowing a lot about me than I am with Facebook or Google or the US government. 

            I tend to think that any data that's collected should be available to all.

			This site might look a little weird as you navigate around. I intend it to be a little history of the web and history of how I learned the basics of web development. As I "create content" for the website, I'll add features, structure and formatting as necessary. The first iteration of the site will be pure static html and css. As of February 2020, anything you're looking at was hand written. No templates used, no dynamic building of pages, no css libraries. As I put together a site template and structure I hope to add more sophisticated features. Apologies if the design of the site is offensively bad, it isn't my strong suit.
