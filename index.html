            Hi, I'm Hugh
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm interested in programming, data analysis especially of a spatial nature, making software and cities work better for their least powerful users and repairing mechanical things. 
          </p> 
          <p> 
            Don't hesitate to reach out to say hi, tell me how you found this site, ask a question or tell me why I'm wrong about something. 
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the main goals of this site is my effort to control my personal data myself and to make data about my life available to other people. 

            Over time I hope to have the majority of my exercise data, travel data, spending data and anything else I can think of up here for your enjoyment.  
          </p>
          <p>

            One of the things that prompted me to do this was thinking about who I'm most comfortable having information about my life.

            If you're reading this, I'm probably much more comfortable with you knowing a lot about me than I am with Facebook or Google or the US government. 

            I tend to think that any data that's collected should be available to all. 
          </p>
          <p>
            we'll see if I come to regret that.

        The Master's thesis that I completed in September is available on github. If you want to read more about that I hope to have a quick <a href="v1/blog.html">blog post</a> up about it soon. 

        You can also see the contibutions I've made to Pandas so far, which has been a great way to learn some professional codebase management and development techniques as well as just becoming more familiar with git and github best practices. 

        I also know how to ask a question on 
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.c#facfbfom/users/3033634/hugh-kelley">
          stack overflow
        </a> 
        without being hounded off the site!

        Someday I hope to have a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hugh_Kelley3">ResearchGate</a> profile worth looking at too. That could be a while though. The two papers I'm working on publishing are pretty early in life. 
    <h3>Ancient History</h3>
    <p>
      In a past life I was a registered investment advisor and worked as an analyst mostly on portfolio construction and on building combinations of actively managed equity portfolios
      Here's my very short and very clean <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/individual/summary/6461678" >U-4 </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While a career as an investment advisor or financial analyst of any kind was clearly not for me, I'm always happy to talk to people about whether they need their very own professional financial investment advisor (Almost definitely not (you shouldn't pay someone to do your taxes either &#129322 (whoa parentheses within parentheses (if you've made it this deep, you now know lisp)))) to work with, how they can lead a healthy financial life, or just answer random questions about financial markets or economics. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want someone to take a less partial look at an investment portfolio or product that you've been offered I'd be happy to do so. Odds are, my advice will be that you shouldn't buy it.

      <h2>Fun</h2>
      <p>
        I have a bunch of hobbies that I try to keep track of at the less professional part of this site where I play around with formatting and different tools for building websites. You can get to that part with this <a href="/v1/home.html">link</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      I've recently started trying to write thoughts or reviews of the books I read. I've almost always got plans for improving whatever bike I'm currently riding. I've played rugby in the past, although I'm pretty beaten up and I'm currently focused on fixing some broke body parts focusing on core strength and flexibility.  I'm also planning to write up a few projects I've finished, building a wodden work bench, repairing a yardsale Kitchenaid from the 1980's, and some other things as well but don't hold your breath.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <h3>The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis </h3>
      <h4>The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment: University College London: 2018-2019</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/">CASA </a> does a bunch of really cool stuff. I studied how modern quantitative methods from Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Geography can 
      inform modern cities, their citizens, their planning, and their something else.

      I studied economics and chinese. It was really hard. I spent a lot of time with the rugby team, worked a few different student jobs and didn't get nearly enough sleep.
