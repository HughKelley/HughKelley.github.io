    I've been lucky to have some amazing mentors and teachers. This was because I was a part of a few really exceptional insitutions.
</p>

<h3>The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis </h3>
<h4>The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment: University College London: 2018-2019</h4>
<p style="text-align:left;color:#2b0000"><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/">CASA </a> does a bunch of really cool stuff. I studied how modern quantitative methods from Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Geography can 
inform modern cities, their citizens, their planning, and their something else.
 </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">
  Macalester College
</h3>
<h4>
  St Paul, MN: 2009-2013
</h4>
<p> 
I studied economics and chinese. It was really hard. I spent a lot of time with the rugby team, worked a few different student jobs and didn't get nearly enough sleep. 
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">London School of Economics and Political Science </h3>
<p> 
  My junior year I spent at the LSE. I took the standard Macro-econ class and statistics for economics. The reason I was there though was to study <i>The Economic History of China</i> and <i>The Philosophy of Economics</i> I'd highly recommend both topics and can offer reading suggestions to anyone interested, though I think it would mean regaining access to an acient dropbox account that I used that year.

<h3>
  Albany High School
</h3>
<p> 
  Despite its reputation AHS offered more AP classes than any other highschool in the Capital District and the opputunity to earn an international baccalaureate diploma, which I did as well as an <i>advanced</i> nys regents diploma.

  I was a competitive highschool rower and much less competitive high school swimmer. If you're a swimmer it might be informative to know that my preferred event was the 500. 
</p>


<h3>St Pius X</h3>
<p>
  I had some great teachers and friends at SPX. I learned the word "sovereignty" from Mr M and only was suspended once &#128512;. 


</p>

<h3> 
  Maria College Kindergarden
</h3>

  I saw the monarch butterflies start to emerge from their "chrysalises" in kindergarten. 
  We had one of these parachute things and it was awesome.
