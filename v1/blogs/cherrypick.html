git is about comparing versions of a directory.

a really useful tool for doing this in some situations is cherry picking.

first, update master.

then create a new branch that is up to date with the upstream origin

Then you want to "pick" through the commits you made previously to another fork.

as you pick through, you bring in only the commits you want to keep leaving behind sutff that isn't necessary for the PR request you want to make.

Why s this useful?

Most simply, sometimes a PR/fork just gets too messy to be managed effetively. Other times you may want to try a new approach to solving an issue without having to rewrite all of the code you've already produced.

you identify commits by using git log and git reflog to identify the commitSha.
